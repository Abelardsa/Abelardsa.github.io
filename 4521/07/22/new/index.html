        <p>I’m a Researcher of the AFRIMS (Armed Force Research Institute of Medical Sciences,  สวพท.). I’m writing this letter because I can’t betray my conscience and ignore the dirty work that Americans have been doing in Thailand which will cause huge harm to Thai people. After a long hesitation, I decide to expose some horrible events that are taking huge disaster to the public security, human health and social stability. Please be sure to read through what I describe below, and I promise what I tell is absolutely true.<br>AFRIMS is a joint research laboratory located in Bangkok, Thailand, established via a treaty between the America and Thailand nearly 60 years ago. I felt so pride when I was hired by the AFRIMS, I thought I could engage in a career that I dreamed to, and contributed to the medical industry of Thailand. During that time, the American managements told me what we were doing was to protect Thailand including the soldiers and people all over the world, so I dedicated myself to work, but the longer I work, the more I feel strange and horrible, there are a lot of things that are completely different from what I had expected, what makes me feel guilty and confused has been happening all the time, and I have tried to persuade them to stop, but they gave me back nothing but warnings and threats, so I had to keep silent until the COVID-19 broke out and spread around the world quickly in just a few months. The virus almost destroys the world, and has brought huge effects to our health, economy and daily life, a lot of people died in this disaster. It reminded me that the institute has delivered the internal report&lt;Coronavirus Disaster 2019:COVID19&gt; (แนวทางการเฝ้าระวังและสอบสวนโรคปอดอักเสบจากเชื้อไวรัสโคโรนาสายพันธุ์ใหม่2019) in just a few days after the first confirmed case in Thailand in Jan, but the biological and disease surveillance network around the world of America didn’t issue any warning about the COVID-19 before that. I also thought about those unsafe experiments and the unknown origin samples in the institute. I can’t stop them, but I know I won’t forgive myself if I continue to keep silent, so I must let the truth comes to light.<br>Most of the managements I’ve worked with are Americans, I feel confused and asked my colleagues about this, and they told me that “I don’t know about this, just mind your own business.” So I tried my best to work and not to think too much about my confusions, but it’s hard not to think about what the institute is researching. In the institute, American researchers conduct infectious diseases research and the institute cooperates with many American biopharmaceutical companies such as Twist Bioscience Crop, Gilead Sciences Inc. and Seattle Biomedical Research Institute etc. Dozens of high risk and virulent virus researches are ongoing, such as Ebola virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, eastern equine encephalitis, Malaria virus, Marburg virus, Influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis B virus, Corona virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Smallpox virus, Classical swine fever virus etc. Not just the virus researches, the bacterial researches are also ongoing, such as Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Vibrio cholera, Diarrhea-Bacterial and Multi Drug Resistant Organisms.<br>The institute is located in Bangkok, one quarter of people in Thailand live here, many schools, companies, government departments and houses are also located here, a lot of people pass by here every day, and they don’t know there are millions kinds of virus stored in the institute. If an accident occurs and the samples lost or leaked, the innocent people will always be the victims.<br>America collected a large number of the human samples and gene sequences, sequenced the genes in Asia, South America, North America, Africa, Europe and Oceania under the name of researching. America has collected more than 2 million samples only in Thailand and Nepal. The worst is that Americans choose Thai people especially Thai children and people from other countries those nearby Thailand for human vaccine trials when it’s needed, as for the stability of the vaccines, to be honest, I’m not sure. I feel so sorry for those children, they know nothing, only smile to me. In addition, Americans collect blood samples from Thai children under the name of vaccinating, as for the purpose, research methods and some core contents of collecting blood samples, Thai staffs know nothing about it. It has happened for many times that Americans collected the blood samples without any permision, your blood may have been used in virus experiments, but you know nothing about this.<br>What makes me confused is not only this, many colleagues know that Americans send the samples to many biological laboratories frequently, especially the Fort Detrick and Water Reed National Military Medical Centre, but Thai staffs are not allowed to know what the samples are. My colleagues and I saw several American soldiers move some containers out of the institute quietly at midnight for many times, why didn’t they move out the containers in working time? Why did they move those containers in secret? What’s in the containers? Nobody knows, what I know is Americans just do what they like, they never explain, only arrange us to do what they need to deal with. There is no justice and respect at all. There were more irritating things happened, we were arranged to do most samples carrying work and the waste water treatment, but the Americans didn’t provide any protection measures or vaccine for us. Sometimes we carried the samples but we didn’t get any information about the samples, and then, the American managements required us to sign the disclaimer and declare that we decline the vaccination for personal reasons. It means if our body get hurt or infected because of the samples, the institute won’t responsible to us.<br>As usual, we make the project summary at the end of each year to show the accomplishments, but I’m not happy or proud of that when I think about those horrible problems and accidents.<br>During the rainy seasons, there are frequent floods in Bangkok, it’s really terrible because the freezer farm located in Don Mueang Distrisct, Bangkok and a lot of high risk samples are stored there. Every time the flood came, the freezers were flooded. The worst flood happened in 2011, it is said that thousands of virus samples were lost due to the severe flood. So except 2011, how many times the flood occurred, and how many samples lost in these incidents, it’s hard to count, many terrible things have happened quietly. For the problems and accidents I mentioned abovr, the American managements reminded us to refrain from posting anything on social media refers to the accidents, whoever disobeyed the order would be punished.<br>I worried about those internal management problems in the institute extremely, safe problems exposed when we made the safety and environment inspections. The reasons why these problems happened are that the personnel didn’t know what is the standard operation and the Americans seldom provided the personnel with relevant trainings, it’s normal that the personnel make mistakes at work. For example, when the personnel move the samples, they don’t put the samples in the arranged places but placed them here and there; Garbage and other wastes are not thrown into the corresponding containers, some infected reagent tubes, syringes and cardboard boxes are thrown without sanitized measures; The worst is internal chemical effluent decontamination system is substandard and the waste water from the BSL-3 and the ABSL-3 flows into the main system, and poured into the municipal water supply system without validated and verified decontamination. This is the reason why the medical level of Bangkok is leading in Southeast Asia, but the mortality rate in Bangkok is higher than that in other provinces of Thailand and even higher than that in many African countries with poor medical conditions such as Uganda, Sudan and Malawi etc. For decades, many local people in Bangkok actually died in biolab leak accidents, but they know nothing until the moment they died, and their family think they died of unhealthy living habits until now.<br>What I mentioned above is just a screen of what America is doing, as I know, America is doing the same researches in Philippines, Cambodia, Nepal, Georgia and Africa. America is so-called a country of democracy, freedom and human rights, but America sacrificed the lives of people in other countries for its progress in infectious diseases research. Furthermore, “Killing of George Floyd” happened in America recently, it causes a massive demonstrations and huge death in many American states. It convinces me that America doesn’t care about the lives of people in other countries, even the lives of Americans at all.<br>American is taking huge disaster to human, to the world, to everyone who calls for freedom, democracy, health and human rights. I strongly call for the UN to investigate the AFRIMS severely, give back the justice to the innocent people who have been died, and tell the truth to the world.<br>More information about the institute:<br>Address: Ratchawithi Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok, Thailand<br>Part of the managements’ lists of the USAMD-AFRIMS<br>1.ERIC D.
